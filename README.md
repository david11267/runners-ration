🔹 1. Carbohydrate Intake Before a Run
To avoid gastrointestinal issues while still being energized:

Formula:
1–4 grams of carbs per kg of body weight depending on how many hours before the run you're eating.

Time Before Run Carb Amount (g/kg body weight)
1 hour 1 g/kg
2 hours 2 g/kg
3 hours 3 g/kg
4 hours 4 g/kg

Example:
If a runner weighs 70 kg and eats 2 hours before:

70 × 2 = 140g of carbs

🟡 Avoid too much fat and fiber before running to reduce risk of bowel issues.

🔹 2. During the Run (For Long Runs)
Only relevant for runs longer than 60–75 minutes.

Formula:
30–60g carbs per hour for moderate runs

Up to 90g carbs/hour for intense endurance (using multiple carb types like glucose + fructose)

💡 Products like gels, bananas, or isotonic drinks work well here.

🔹 3. Hydration
General hydration guidance is more flexible, but:

Drink ~400–600 ml of water 1–2 hours before a run

During the run: ~150–250 ml every 20 minutes (depending on sweat rate)

Include electrolytes for longer or hot weather runs.

🔹 4. Post-Run Recovery
For recovery, the “3:1 ratio” is often used:

Formula:
1g protein + 3g carbs per kg of body weight within 30–60 minutes after running

Example:
70 kg runner:

210g carbs + 70g protein

This aids glycogen replenishment and muscle repair.
